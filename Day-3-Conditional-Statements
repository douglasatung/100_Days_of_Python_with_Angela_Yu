'''Day 3.0: Control flow with if/else and conditional operators'''
# If statement is stating the condition that either something is true or not, for example a rollercoaster requirement for heights of 120cm and above only

print("Welcome to the rollercoaster ride")
# The user is asked to input their heights in cm, and condition given here is that, if the rider is 120cm or above, he/she can ride else, they have to wait until they grow taller

# The conditional statement is showing if the user is above 120cm they can ride else they can't

  # If they are not upto 120cm, the can't ride the rollercoaster
else:
  print("\nSorry, you can't ride the rollercoaster")

'''Day 3.1: Odd or Even Exercise'''
# Example: write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number
number = int(input("Enter any number for checking: "))

# Using the conditional statement to check the number
if number % 2 == 0:
  print("This is a even number")
# If the number is not even, then the statement should read as
else:

'''Day 3.1.2: Nested if statements and elif statements'''

# EXAMPLE: Write a program showing that the user can use the rollercoaster with variosus amount within a age brackets in nested if statement

height = int(input("State your height in cm: "))

  # If they are not upto 120cm, the can't ride the rollercoaster

'''Day 3.2: BMI 2.0 Exercise'''
# Example: Calculate the body mass index 2.0

# Inputint the weight and height of the user

weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg? "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in m: "))

# Calculating the BMI we have that

bmi = round(weight / height ** 2)

# Stating our conditional statements using if and elif statements

'''Day 3.3.0: Leap Year Exercise'''
# Checking on when the input year is a leap year

'''Day 3.3.1: Multiple if statements in succession'''

# EXAMPLE: Write a program showing that the user can use the rollercoaster with with an option of taking a picture as well

'''Day 3.4.1: Logical Operators'''
# The logical operators consist of three items namely AND(When both conditions are true), OR (When one of the conditions is true) and NOT (when the condition is not true)

# From our rollercoaster example, we will use the AND to carry out a task granting people with age 45 to 55 free rollercoaster ride
