'''Day-2: Exploration of Data types such as strings, integer, float and boolean and 
#The method of pulling out a particular element from a string is call subscripting
# Printing a specific number from list of numbers'''

# To print the letter o, we use example 1 or 2
print("Hello"[-1])
#or
print("Hello"[4])
print("5 + 2")
print(32 - 5)

# Integers are absolute numerical values for example
120

# Float are numerical values with decimal points example

1.205

# Boolean are values with either is True or False
True
False

'''Day-2.0: Type Error, Type checking and type conversion'''

num_char = len(input("What is your name "))
# For us to get our desired value without breaking, we need to convert num_char into strings 
new_num_char = str(num_char)
print("\nYour name has " + new_num_char + " characters.")

# To check data type, we define the variable and check their type such as

a = 12563

# To check the type of a we code that

print(type(a))

# The above states that a is an integer. Now lets say we write

a1 = str(12563)
print(type(a1))

# The value of a1 printed as a string

# Now lets say we write
a2 = float(12563)
print(type(a2))
# The value of a1 printed as a float

# What will this line of code print below?

print(76 + float("120.3"))

# The out for this code is 196.3

'''Day-2.1: Data Types Exercise'''

# Example: Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 65, then the output should be 6 + 5 = 11

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

####################################
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# We define the variables for first and second value and also print out the list value for each number
first_value = two_digit_number[0]
second_value = two_digit_number[1]

# We very the type of two_digit_number
# print(type(two_digit_number))
# And we found that the type is a string

# We now convert the first and second value into integers
result = int(first_value) + int(second_value)
# Print the value of the result
print(result)

'''Day-2.1.1: Mathematical Operations in Python'''

# In python just like in Mathematics, following symbols steel maintains their normal meaning

+ multiplication
- Subtraction
/ Division with a float value
// Division with int value 
* Multiplication
** Exponential of any numerical value 

# In python, we have a mathematical procedure called PEMDASL

# P - Parenthesis
# E - Exponential
# M - Multiplication
# D - Division 
# A - Addition
# S - Subtraction
# LR - Left to Right

# Exercise: print 3*3+3/3-3 to obtain an integer not a float value

# Answer is, we divide the value of with double multiplication symbol i.e. //

print(3 * 3 + 3 // 3 - 3)

# The value obtained is 7 not 7.0

# Also to print something out of the order of the PEMDAS, we can isolate 3 + 3 inside parenthesis for the computer to compute it first before others e.g

print(3 * (3 + 3) // 3 - 3)

# This means the computer first solve 3 + 3 before solving the others'''

'''Day 2.1.2 Calculation of PROJECT_1_(Body Mass Index: BMI)'''

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# Calculating the Body Mass Index converting the weight and height into integers and floats
bmi = int(weight) / float(height) ** 2

# To obtain an integer as the body mass index, we convert the bmi into integers
bmi_as_int = int(bmi)
# Print the bmi as integers
print(bmi_as_int)


'''Day 2.2: Number manipulation and F-Strings in Python'''

# We can carry out arithmetic calculations in python i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

# 8 / 3 will give a remainder of 2.6666
print(8 / 3)

# We can get a round figure without any decimal place

print(round(8 / 3))
# We can also round the numbers into any decimal point via

print(round(8 / 3, 3)) 
# This meant that we calculate into three decimal points

# or we can calculate to get an integer without rounding the figures using the double slash (//) with getting any decimal point e.g

print(8 // 3)

# We can carry out an arithmetic calculation and still continue the calculation, lets say we divide 4 / 2 and also want to divide the value by another 2 again, we write as

result = 4 / 2
# to further divide the value of the result by another number we write as

result /= 2

# now printing the result will give us the final value of 4/2/2=1 as a float number

print(result)

# Addition of continues arithmetic calculations

score = 0
# Adding another score we have
score += 1
# Printing the sum of score = 0 + 1
print(score)

# Subtraction
age = 15
# Subtracting two more years
age -= 3
print("Your new age is now: ", age)

# Multiplication
salary = 1200
# Multiplying monthly salary by two months
salary *= 2
# print
print("Your two months salary is now: ", salary)

# F-STRING coding
# Printing strings, integers, and booleans can be very difficult because one will need to concatenate all three at one, but with the use of f-string, we can print as many variables as we want such as

score = 10
height = 1.69
can_swim = True

# To print the three, we need to insert letter f in front of the string variable we are printing
print(f"Your arithmetic score is: {score}, also your height is {height}m, and that the rumor flying round saying you can swim is {can_swim }")
# After inserting the print(f""{}) the curly braces are used to insert the values of other variables we want to print along with the variable saving us from concatenation complications

'''Day 2.3: PROJECT_2_[Interactive coding exercise] Life in weeks'''

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
#Converting my current age into an integer 
current_age_int = int(age)

# Defining the maximum age which is 90

maximum_age = 90

# Calculating the remaining years is subtracting the current_age_int from the maximum_age that is

remaining_age = maximum_age - current_age_int
# We first multipy each of the days, weeks and months remaining for the person to reach 90years that is

remaining_days = remaining_age * 365
remaining_weeks = remaining_age * 52
remaining_months = remaining_age * 12

# Printing the program showing the remaining years left for one to reach 90years, showing the remaining days, weeks and months using formating string (f-string)
# print(f"\nIf you live until {maximum_age} years old.")
print(f"\nYou have {remaining_days} days, {remaining_weeks} weeks, and {remaining_months} months left.")


'''Day 2 PROJECT_3_: Tip Calculator'''
# Print a welcome statement
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")

# Input the bill value as float
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $ "))

# Input the percentage of the tip
tip = int(input("How much percentage would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))

# people to split the bill

people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

# Now to calculate the bill with tip
tip_as_percent = tip / 100

total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent

total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount

bill_per_person = total_bill / people
final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)

final_amount ="{:.2f}".format(bill_per_person)

print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
